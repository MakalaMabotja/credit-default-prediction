## **Project Architecture Overview**

You'll break the system down into five key microservices:

1. **Data Ingestion and Processing Service**
2. **Data Analysis and Statistical Testing Service**
3. **Model Training, Cross-Validation, and Logging Service**
4. **Model Interpretation and Ensemble Service**
5. **Model Deployment and API Service**

Each microservice will run independently, communicate via APIs, and use Azure services for scalability and efficiency.

## 2. **Microservices Breakdown**

### 2.1 **Data Ingestion and Processing Service**

#### **Responsibilities**:

- Read data from CSV files.
- Transform and load data into a SQL database in a star schema.
- Feature engineering (e.g., creating dimension tables for time intelligence, customer information, and interest rates).

#### **Design Patterns**:

- **ETL Pipeline Pattern**: Extract, Transform, Load in stages.
- **Factory Pattern**: To handle different data sources or transformations dynamically.

#### **Azure Services**:

- **Azure Data Factory**: For orchestrating the ETL process.
- **Azure SQL Database**: To store data in a star schema.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: To store raw CSV files.

#### **Technologies**:

- Python (`pandas`, `SQLAlchemy`)
- FastAPI for microservice endpoints
- Pydantic for data validation

---

### 2.2 **Data Analysis and Statistical Testing Service**

#### **Responsibilities**:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Conduct statistical tests (e.g., distribution checks, A/B tests).
- Ensure new data adheres to the same statistical patterns as historical data.

#### **Design Patterns**:

- **Strategy Pattern**: To dynamically choose different statistical tests or EDA methods.
- **Observer Pattern**: For monitoring changes in data distributions.

#### **Azure Services**:

- **Azure Databricks**: For scalable data analysis and Spark-based computations.
- **Azure Monitor**: To track statistical anomalies and log results.

#### **Technologies**:

- Python (`scipy`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- FastAPI for microservice endpoints

---

### 2.3 **Model Training, Cross-Validation, and Logging Service**

#### **Responsibilities**:

- Train models using LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.
- Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Log experiments and metrics.

#### **Design Patterns**:

- **Builder Pattern**: For constructing different models with configurations.
- **Command Pattern**: To encapsulate model training tasks as commands.
- **Singleton Pattern**: For managing the MLFlow instance.

#### **Azure Services**:

- **Azure Machine Learning**: For model training and tracking.
- **Azure MLFlow**: For experiment tracking and logging.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: For deploying training jobs at scale.

#### **Technologies**:

- Python (`scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `mlflow`)
- FastAPI for triggering training jobs
- SQLAlchemy for storing results in the SQL database

---

### 2.4 **Model Interpretation and Ensemble Service**

#### **Responsibilities**:

- Provide model interpretability using SHAP, LIME, or visualizations.
- Combine multiple models using ensemble methods (e.g., stacking, weighted averaging).

#### **Design Patterns**:

- **Composite Pattern**: For combining different models in an ensemble.
- **Decorator Pattern**: To add interpretability features to models.

#### **Azure Services**:

- **Azure Machine Learning**: For managing ensemble models.
- **Azure Functions**: For running lightweight interpretability tasks on demand.

#### **Technologies**:

- Python (`shap`, `lime`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- FastAPI for interpretability endpoints

---

### 2.5 **Model Deployment and API Service**

#### **Responsibilities**:

- Deploy the trained model via RESTful APIs.
- Validate input data using Pydantic.
- Serve predictions and credit scores.

#### **Design Patterns**:

- **Adapter Pattern**: To adapt the model output to the required API response.
- **Proxy Pattern**: To add security or logging before reaching the model.

#### **Azure Services**:

- **Azure App Service**: For hosting the FastAPI application.
- **Azure SQL Database**: For storing prediction logs and metadata.
- **Azure API Management**: For managing and securing APIs.

#### **Technologies**:

- FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- Docker for containerization

## 3. **Azure Services Mapping**

| **Microservice**                              | **Azure Service**                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Data Ingestion and Processing                 | Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Database  |
| Data Analysis and Statistical Testing         | Azure Databricks, Azure Monitor         |
| Model Training, Cross-Validation, and Logging | Azure ML, MLFlow, AKS                   |
| Model Interpretation and Ensemble             | Azure ML, Azure Functions               |
| Model Deployment and API                      | Azure App Service, Azure API Management |

## 4. **Workflow Diagram**

1. **Ingestion**: Raw CSV → Azure Blob Storage → Data Factory → SQL Database (Star Schema).
2. **Analysis**: Data Analysis Service fetches data → Performs statistical checks → Logs anomalies.
3. **Training**: Training Service retrieves data → Trains models → Logs to MLFlow → Stores model artifacts.
4. **Interpretation**: Interpretation Service provides insights and visualizations on models.
5. **Deployment**: Deployment Service exposes model predictions and credit scoring via FastAPI.

---

## 5. **Key Considerations**

1. **Scalability**: Deploy each microservice independently using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scaling.
2. **Logging & Monitoring**: Use MLFlow, Azure Monitor, and Azure Application Insights.
3. **Security**: Secure APIs with Azure API Management and use Azure Key Vault for secrets management.
4. **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines with Azure DevOps.
5. **Data Governance**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, POPIA).

This design ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable end-to-end data science project, leveraging microservices and Azure cloud services effectively.
