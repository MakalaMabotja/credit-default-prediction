# Credit Default Prediction

## üìå Overview

This project was developed for the [Zindi African Credit Scoring Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/african-credit-scoring-challenge/submissions), where the goal was to **predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan** using financial and demographic data.

The solution achieves an **F1 score of 0.8844**, placing it among the top-performing approaches. Beyond accuracy, the system was designed with a **microservices architecture** to ensure scalability, modularity, and real-world deployment readiness.

## üèó Project Architecture

The system follows a **microservices design**, with each service running independently and communicating via APIs. Azure cloud services are used for scalability, monitoring, and deployment.

### Microservices

1. **Data Ingestion & Processing**

   - Ingests CSV data, transforms, and loads into a SQL star schema.
   - Feature engineering (time intelligence, customer dimensions, interest rates).

2. **Data Analysis & Statistical Testing**

   - Performs EDA and statistical checks.
   - Ensures new data aligns with historical patterns.

3. **Model Training & Logging**

   - Trains LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.
   - Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and MLflow logging.

4. **Model Interpretation & Ensembling**

   - Provides explainability with SHAP/LIME.
   - Combines models via stacking and weighted averaging.

5. **Model Deployment & API Service**
   - Deploys models via FastAPI endpoints.
   - Serves predictions and a credit scoring function that bins probabilities into risk categories.
